# Hi there, I´m Franco Pizzi 👋💻

**Passionate about technology.**
- *I enjoy innovating, creating, growing and generating solutions to daily recurrent problems.*
- *The part that I enjoy of programming is when I have to resolve a problem of my code or*
*when I start thinking how to implement a new functionality.*
- *I´m always looking to improve my skills and learned new technologyes.*

                  Mobile. Personally, I had to participate in the last one. We use React Native for the 
                  Front end and Redux for managing application states. The functionalities that I had to 
                  participate in were, Login-Logout, Google login, Google register, favorites section, 
                  reservation management and payment through Mercado Pago. At the end of the project, 
                  I helped in the back end to carry out the availability and reservation routes."
