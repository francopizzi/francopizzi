## Hi there, IÂ´m Franco Pizzi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

**Passionate about technology.**
       *I enjoy innovating, creating, growing and generating solutions to daily recurrent problems.*
       *The part that I enjoy of programming is when I have to resolve a problem of my code or*
       *when I start thinking how to implement a new functionality.*
       *IÂ´m always looking to improve my skills and learned new technologyes.*
