# Hi there, IÂ´m Franco Pizzi ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

**Passionate about technology.**
- *I enjoy innovating, creating, growing and generating solutions to daily recurrent problems.*
- *The part that I enjoy of programming is when I have to resolve a problem of my code or*
*when I start thinking how to implement a new functionality.*
- *IÂ´m always looking to improve my skills and learned new technologyes.*
